# Discriminative tasks: SET

SET is a card game which forms a cognitive task relying on parsing relations between objects across several visual features.

**SET: modeling multi-dimensional relations**

In this experiment, we compare an Abstractor to CoRelNet on the task of classifying whether a triplet of card images forms a set or not.

Steps for reproduction: run `set_classification.ipynb`

**SET: Comparison of Abstractor's relation representation to symbolically encoded relations**

In this experiment, we compare the relational representations produced by an Abstractor to a symbolic encoding of the relations.

Steps for reproduction: run `set_symbolic_baseline.ipynb`
